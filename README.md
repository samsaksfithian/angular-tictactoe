# Angular Project

Super basic Tic-Tac-Toe game used as a tutorial to begin learning AngularJS.

## Task

1. Learn Angular basics either through
   1. [Angular store tutorial](https://angular.io/start) - more high-level, quick start up
   2. [Angular Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial) - more in-depth, bigger time commitment
   3. Any other online resources
2. Create a miniature front-end application
   1. Pick a project with a small scope. You only have 3 days to work on this.
   2. Pitch the project to either Scott or Andrew
   3. Once approved, please make a GitHub repository with a `README` that outlines:
      1. Project overview
      2. Requirements/features
      3. Time estimates for each part
   4. Prototype, briefly
   5. Develop the application
   6. Deploy (and make sure to put the link to your live app in your `README`!)
      1. [Here is a tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/deploying-an-angular-app-to-netlify) on how you can deploy with Netlify
